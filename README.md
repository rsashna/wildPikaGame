# wildPikaGame

This game is one of the two minigames made for the *Media Center Project* on the ARM CortexM3 chip board with LED pixel graphics and joystick controller. 
This repo is written in javascript due to limited hardware availability, and then replicated with the same logic in the C language for the ARM microchip.

The *Media Center Project* can be found in the github repo 'embProj' from here - https://github.com/rsashna/embProj/tree/master/givns/examples/LCD_Blinky
